            <h1>Myths About Clotho</h1>
        </center>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spinning the Thread of Life:</strong> Clotho was responsible for spinning the thread of life for every mortal and god. She held the power to determine the beginning of one's life.</li>
                <li><strong>The Eternal Spinner:</strong> According to myth, Clotho's spinning was relentless, symbolizing the continuous passage of time and the inevitability of fate.</li>
                <li><strong>Influence Over Destinies:</strong> While Clotho spun the thread, her sisters, Lachesis and Atropos, determined its length and cut it, respectively. Thus, Clothoâ€™s role was crucial but only a part of the grand design of fate.</li>
                <li><strong>Mythical Depictions:</strong> In art, Clotho is often depicted holding a spindle or a spinning wheel, representing her role in weaving the tapestry of life.</li>
