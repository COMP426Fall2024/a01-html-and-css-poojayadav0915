            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cutting the Thread of Life:</strong> Atropos was responsible for cutting the thread of life spun by Clotho and measured by Lachesis. Her role was to decide when a person’s life would end.</li>
                <li><strong>The Inevitable End:</strong> Atropos’ decision was final and irreversible, symbolizing the inevitability of death and the end of life’s journey.</li>
                <li><strong>Role in the Fate Trio:</strong> While Clotho spun the thread and Lachesis measured it, Atropos had the crucial task of cutting it, marking the end of a person’s life.</li>
                <li><strong>Symbolic Depictions:</strong> In art, Atropos is often depicted with a pair of shears or a dagger, representing her role in cutting the thread of life.</li>
